Dashboards aggregate multiple query datasets, visualizations, and texts into
one handy view.

To add widgets to a dashboard, select the query you want to feature and the
relevant visualization. By default, query results are shown in a table.

At the moment it's not possible to create a new visualization from the "Add
Widget" menu, so you'll need to open the query and add the visualization there
beforehand ([instructions](http://help.redash.io/article/56-creating-a-new-
visualization))
