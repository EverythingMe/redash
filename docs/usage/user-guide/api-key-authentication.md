All the API calls support authentication with an API key. Redash has two types
of API keys:

  * User API Key: has the same permissions as the user who owns it. Can be found on a user profile page.
  * Query API Key: has access only to the query and its results. Can be found on the query page.

Whenever possible we recommend using a Query API key.
