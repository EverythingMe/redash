To load a CSV file from a URL, you use the CSV file address as the query text
(i.e. https://example.com/file.csv ). Redash expects a CSV file with a header
as the first row.

To further filter or manipulate the data you can use the [Query Results data
source](http://help.redash.io/article/152-using-query-results-as-data-
sources).
