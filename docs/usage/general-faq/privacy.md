Redash is hosted on AWS and we follow the best practices:

1

    All our servers are in a private network and are not accessible from the Internet, except for the load balancer and a bastion server for SSH (that does not have any credentials on it). 
2

    HTTPS/SSL for everything. 
3

    2FA for our internal systems.

If you have any specific concerns, please Contact Us and we'll be happy to
help.
